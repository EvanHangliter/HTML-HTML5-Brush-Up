HTML &amp; HTML5 Brush Up
<!--I am using this to brush up on some of the HTML and HTML5 I learned in highschool on Codecademy. Nothing too special here. This simply shows my love of cats (could this line be sarcastic?). I guess you will have to ask me.-->

          - creating a "dead" link
          - internal linking using #
      - img src adding images to a web page
      - list = both structure <ol> and unstructure <ul>
